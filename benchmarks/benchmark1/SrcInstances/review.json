The time he has spent here has been very productive and working with him educational and enjoyable. I hope not to need him again (though this is highly unlikely) but knowing he is there if I do is very nice. By the way, I'm not from El Centro, CA. but Scottsdale, AZ.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"},

Well, after 10 seconds they fixed the problem. As the owner of a company that does our best numbers over the holiday season, having my phone out of order for 4.5 hours was horrible. Sharpie Tech fixed the problem in record time, even Verizon was shocked. I highly recommend working with this company and I look forward to working with them more. nn-Rachel CharlupskinFounder and CEO, The Babysitting Company","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"},

From clothing to couches they have it all and great prices too.  They have similar items to their neighbors Modern Manor, but not the designer prices.  We got a green vintage chair for $98 and just are having the skirt around the bottom removed to show the great legs on it.  We will always check back at Melrose when looking for unique pieces for our home.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"},
